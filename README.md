# Exploring ML with python!

## Introduction
As an introduction/refresher to this kind of projects, we've teamed up to explore the machine learning space using available tools like python and kaggle to challenge ourselves to improve our understanding about the field. 

## Objectives
- The first objective of the project would be to gather data about state-of-the-art techniques and how they're applied to diferent use-cases in order to choose a field in which to work on further given that the project serves the function of an introduction and we still don't know what will motivate us the most.
- Another one would be as we said before improving our knowledge of ML and data engineering techniques in general, bringing us closer to a level where we can use this to add value to our clients/job/...
- Have Fun! :D | We don't do this for a living! (At least right now hehe)

## Methodology
During the first stage of the project (est. 2 weeks), we would like to achieve the following :

- Search for interesting datasets as well as objectives on the dataset (Documenting them in order to share them between us and taking notes on what makes them cool/interesting for research)
- Search for state of the art (or not known by us) models in general in which we have interest in order to try to match them to the use-cases we researched.
- Start Coding!! (with the appropiate steps/boring stuff)


## Nice to Haves 
- Data analysis and exploration on the dataset --> CRISP-DM
- Cross-validation --> Try diferent techniques and study them
- Research on the most appropriate evaluation metrics --> A bit obvious but ok ;)
- Feature Engineering (the modification and transformation of information for greater accuracy and model performance). --> Cool name <3
