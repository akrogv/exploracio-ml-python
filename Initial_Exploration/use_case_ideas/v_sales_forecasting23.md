# Sales Forecast 2023: V****** 
 Real use case: sales data from an ecommerce. Forecasting 2023 sales.
 
 We have to be aware that being able to work with that information on a real use case with their consent is really valuable. 
 Forecasting in ecommerce is extremly important as is one of their majors losses of money: overstocking or not having enough stock, specially in the company that we are talking about, is no bueno.

## Dataset information

- Sales per SKU per year, at least, 2021 and 2022. Maybe one or two years more.
- Master data (SKU Info)
- Could be able to retrieve more information such as: Google Analytics data or  other years forecast vs accuracy.


## Things to learn

- I find this interesting because we would be working on a real use case, and everything that this means. No prepared and clean dataset. 
- Analytics would tell us real insights of an ecommerce. 
- Real valuable rewards.
- Real understanding of the company.
- I like timeseries forecasting

## Difficulties & Timing

- We need more yearly data --> I have to talk to them and ask where is historical data of sales. 
- Data may present initial problems. Might have to do lots of ETLs and cleaning.
- Timing would be until december. Season starts january 23.

## Score
### **solid 8**
